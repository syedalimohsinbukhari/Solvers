# Cholesky decomposition

Discovered by [Andr√©-Louis Cholesky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9-Louis_Cholesky), this method is applicable for [Hermitian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_matrix), symmetric and [positive-definite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_matrix) matrices.

For each applicable matrix, the Cholesky decomposition reduces the given matrix into a lower-triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose matrix.

Mathematically, it can be written as,

$$\textbf{A} = \textbf{L}\textbf{L}^*$$

For a non-complex matrix, the above statement can also be written as,

$$\textbf{A} = \textbf{L}\textbf{L}^T$$
