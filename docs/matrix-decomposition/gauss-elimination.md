# Gauss elimination

In mathematics, [Gaussian elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination), also known as row reduction, is an algorithm for solving [systems of linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations). It consists of a sequence of row-wise operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients.
