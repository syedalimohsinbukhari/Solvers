# Gauss Jacobi iterative method

In numerical linear algebra, the Jacobi method (a.k.a. the Jacobi iteration method) is an iterative algorithm for determining the solutions of a [strictly diagonally dominant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonally_dominant_matrix) [system of linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations). Each diagonal element is solved for, and an approximate value is plugged in. The process is then iterated until it converges.
